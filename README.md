The project was prepared by a student of the Vinnitsa IT-Academy Bartash Oksana group b-22
Title: Login/Registration Form Mockup
Purpose: Layout of the login/registration form according to the layout, creating a repository in GitHub and uploading the finished code
I made a page that the user can see in the browser when registering and entering data.
There are also some conditions for entering information:
- in the "username" field, the user must enter his first and last name - only letters, numbers and an underscore, at least 3 characters;
- in the password field - you must enter a password of at least 8 characters, it must contain at least one letter and one number.
If the entered data does not meet the condition, a message will appear on the screen.

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

No prerequisites are required to run this project, only computer and access on the Internet.

Built with:
- HTML

This learning project is aimed at promoting the development and strengthening of my skills, as well as
implementation of my own ideas, which will be needed for work on other projects in the future.
